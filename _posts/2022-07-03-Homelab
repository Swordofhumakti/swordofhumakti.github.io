# Overview



## Pi-hole

2022-03-07, Built a Pi-hole in a lxc on proxmox. 
Ubuntu 22.01 currently not supported on Pi-Hole. 



### BT HomeHub Issues

You cant change the DNS settings on the BThomeHub, this will mean i will neeed to run my own DHCP service. This will wait until i have built a proxmox cluster, or a Pi-hole cluster.
