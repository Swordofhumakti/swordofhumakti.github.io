# Executive Summary
**This is very much my personal view, and will chanage over time** 

Most of the documentation talking about **Systemic Risk** focus on how a failure of participants in a market can if they are larger enough cause impacts on their counterparties. This may make some sense to a regulator, but in the case of retail payments systems (to me) the larger impact is on the general population where funds are not made available to end consumers in the timescales they have become acustomised to. Organisations involved in providing payment systems need to understand that just because you "say" the money may be there in 2 hours, if the learnt experience is that the funds are available in 5 seconds, if they are not there in 50 minutes this is likely to generate a level of unrest during days that state benefit payments are being made. 

I would suggest that a better way to look at systemic risk is that when participants fail if the failure impacts a significant percentage of the general public to the point and they are unable to either send or gain access to their funds.
